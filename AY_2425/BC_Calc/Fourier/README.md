# Fourier Analysis Unit
This is a two day unit which will serve as an optional fun thing to insert the day after Spring break before Senior ditch day.

## Goals
 - SWBAT compute a Fourier approximation of a function on the interval [-pi, pi]
 - Students will understand how any piecewise continuous function can be approximated as a Fourier series.
 - Will know how to interpret a spectrogram
 - Will understand the wave equation mathematically and be able to related it to Fourier analysis


## Overview
- Day 1 (35 minute class) : Students learn the definition of a Fourier series and it's relationship with audio.
- Day 2 (85 minute class): Students compute a Fourier series and witness the convergence. We return to the audio examples and interpret the striation patterns we see in spectrograms


## Day 1: What is a spectrogram?

### Bell-ringer (5 minutes)
Each group must make a really random sentence (e.g. She used her own hair in the soup to give it more flavor.)

#### Part 1: Exploring Spectrograms (10 minutes)
1. Students read random sentences into https://spectrogram.sciencemusic.org/ for a bit.
2. Play cello into spectrogram.
3. Ask each group to formulate an explanation of what is being depicted in the spectrogram.  Randomly choose a member of each group to provide their explanation (popsicle sticks)

This raises the question "What is sound" and "What are we really looking at here?"

### Part 2: Biology (3 minutes)
1. Introduce the biology of hearing.
2. Show slow motion video of a bow on a string.

### Part 3: Math (15 minutes)
1. Introduce the fourier decomposition
2. Do a live Fourier Decomposition
2. Introduce the power spectrum

### Part 4: Revisit the spectrograph (5 minutes)
Allow small groups for formulate a new explanation of what the spectrogram is depicting.  Go around to each group to see that they come up with.

Final question: ``What is the deal with the horizontal lines (striations)''

### Homework
- Compute a Fourier Decomposition
- Understand what derivatives and integrals look like in Fourier space.

## Day 2: The wave equation
This is presented on Senior ditch day, so we can have the 8 or so Juniors form one giant table.

### Bell Ringer
What values can $k$ have given pinned boundaries?  Have them work on this until they seem to have derived the quantization
condition.

### The wave equation
1. Play the slow motion video again
2. Introduce the function $h(x,t)$.
3. Introduce the wave equation.
4. Justify the wave equation pictorially.

### Sinusoidal Ansatz
Student discover the pattern that $\omega = \pm k$.

### Linearity
Students discover that the wave equation is linear

### General Solution
Students see how a general solution is a sum of these
Fourier solutions

### Striations revisited
