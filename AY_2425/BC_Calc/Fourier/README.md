# Fourier Analysis Unit
This is a two day unit which will serve as an optional fun thing to insert the day after Spring break before Senior ditch day.

## Goals
 - SWBAT compute a Fourier approximation of a function on the interval [-pi, pi]
 - Students will understand how any piecewise continuous function can be approximated as a Fourier series.
 - Will know how to interpret a spectrogram


## Overview
- Day 1 (35 minute class) : Students learn the definition of a Fourier series and it's relationship with audio.
- Day 2 (85 minute class): Students compute a Fourier series and witness the convergence. We return to the audio examples and interpret the striation patterns we see in spectrograms
