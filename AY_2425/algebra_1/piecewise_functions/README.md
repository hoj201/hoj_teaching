## Piecewise function matching game - EXPLAINED
1. Various plots and piecewise functions are taped to the walls.  Students are handed sheets of paper that also have plots or piecewise functions on them. If they are given a piecewise function, they are asked to find the matching plot.  If they are given a plot, they are asked to find the matching piecewise function.

When a student thinks they have found a match then note the words located in the bottom left of each paper (e.g. "wacky : Gilda").  The teachers have an answer key that tells us if "wacky - gilda" is a match or not.  If they get a match, then we add there name to the [wheel of names](https://wheelofnames.com/)

We then spin the wheel however many times to choose winners.

### How to generate the matches
Run the python script
```shell
make handout.pdf
```
You can then open `handout.pdf`.  To clean up run `make clean`.

## Todo
 - [ ] use exactly one line with a y-intercept for each match
 - [ ] Create one-note with instructions
 - [ ] 2 problems that are verbal/graph
 - [ ] 2 problems that are table/graph
 - [ ] 2 problems that are function/graph
 - [ ] 2 problems that are table/function
 - [ ] print on colored paper
